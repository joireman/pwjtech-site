Title: About Me
Authors: Paul W. Joireman

I am passionate about creating high quality, testable and well documented
software and enjoy working in a dynamic environment where others share this
passion.  I am a software engineer working on server side development for
physIQ, Inc. a health technology startup. We are working to bring a novel
medical device to market that combines remote monitoring of biosignals and
predictive analytics to provide unique and useful information to clinicians and
physicians.  I use [Python](http://www.python.org) for back end development to
process incoming biosignal data through various signal processing and machine
learning algorithms.

I have 12+ years of experience in all different phases of software development,
architecture, design, implementation, testing and deployment.   I have worked
at many different levels from low level embedded hardware/software interfaces
to multi-tiered web application implementation and deployment and am very
comfortable moving between different levels of abstraction.   I currently work
almost exclusively with Python and appreciate its flexibility and the wide
range of excellent packages,
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org)/[scipy](http://www.scipy.org),
[pandas](http://pydata.pandas.org),
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/), [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), etc.  I
often turn to C/C++ when speed is at a premium or the environment requires it
but I have experience with Java, Matlab, LabVIEW and assembly. 

I hold a PhD in Chemistry from UCLA and a BS/BA in Chemistry/Mathematics from
Whitworth University.  I taught chemistry for several years in
such widely separated places as Ethiopia, England, rural Iowa and western NY
state. In the late 90s I was bitten by the programming bug, first learning and
loving C++. I jumped off the academic ship and into the "real world" and spent
almost 10 years as and embedded programmer in the Accelerator Division at Fermi
National Accelerator Lab, using C/C++, Python, LabVIEW and MATLAB. In 2011, I
moved from the large corporate environment of Fermilab to a small startup
working on innovative uses of wearable sensors and predictive analytics to
improve health care.
