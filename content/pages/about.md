Title: About Me
Authors: Paul W. Joireman

I am passionate about creating high quality, testable and well documented
software and enjoy working in a dynamic environment where others share this
passion.  I am a software engineer working on server side development for 
physIQ, Inc. a health technology startup. We are working to bring a novel
medical device to market that combines remote monitoring of biosignals and
predictive analytics to provide unique and useful information to clinicians and
physicians.  I use Python for back end development to process incoming biosignal
data through various signal processing and machine learning algorithms.
